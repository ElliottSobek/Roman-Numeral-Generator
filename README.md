# Roman-Numeral-Generator
Given a number, the program outputs the corresponding roman numeral.

Can be run in any python IDE or unix like environment that's had at least python 3.6.1 installed.

Can generate a roman numeral procedurally or recursive given passed command line arguments.

### Limitations

Can only easily generate number in the hundreds of thousands. Any number
larger than one million will result in a roman numeral with many numeral
repetitions. This limitation is due to the romans largest possible value â†ˆ
(100,000).
